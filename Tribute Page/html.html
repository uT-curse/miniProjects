            <h2>Who was B.R. Ambedkar?</h2>
            <p><b>Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b> popularly known as Babasaheb, was an Indian jurist, economist, politician and social reformer who inspired the Modern Buddhist Movement and campaigned against social discrimination against Untouchables (Dalits),
                while also supporting the rights of women and labour. He was Independent India's first law minister and the principal architect of the Constitution of India. Ambedkar was a prolific student, earning a law degree and various doctorates
                from Columbia University and the London School of Economics, and gained a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics and political science. In his early career he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life
                was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment
                of the state of India. In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred upon Ambedkar.</p>

                <p class="mt-4"><b>Ambedkar's legacy</b> as a socio-political reformer had a deep effect on modern India.In post-Independence India, his socio-political thought is respected across the political spectrum. His initiatives have influenced various spheres
                    of life and transformed the way India today looks at socio-economic policies, education and affirmative action through socio-economic and legal incentives. His reputation as a scholar led to his appointment as free India's first law
                    minister, and chairman of the committee for drafting the constitution. He passionately believed in individual freedom and criticised caste society. His accusations of Hinduism as being the foundation of the caste system made him controversial
                    and unpopular among Hindus.[108] His conversion to Buddhism sparked a revival in interest in Buddhist philosophy in India and abroad.</p>
